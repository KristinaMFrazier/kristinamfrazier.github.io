### Introduction

**Course**: STAT 627 "Statistical Machine Learning"

For this project, I worked with a fellow classmate to build a classification model to classify National Hockey League game wins.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Objective

To classify whether an NHL team would win the majority of goals in a game (even-strength play only), using shot quality and gameplay statistics. The goal was to build a high-performing, interpretable classification model to support data-driven coaching strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Target Variable

-   `xresult`: A binary variable indicating if a team won the majority of expected goals in a game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Predictors

-   `fenwickPercentage`: Possession metric based on unblocked shot attempts
-   `highDangerxGoalsFor` and `highDangerxGoalsAgainst`: Expected goals from high-quality shots
-   `xGoalsFromxReboundsOfShotsFor`: Rebounds contributing to expected goals
-   `shotAttemptsFor`: Total offensive attempts
-   `home_or_away`: Game location indicator

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Models Evaluated

1.  Logistic Regression\
2.  Logistic Regression with Polynomial Terms\
3.  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\
4.  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)\
5.  K-Nearest Neighbors (K = 42)

All models were tested on: - A 50/50 train-test split - 10-fold cross-validation (and LOOCV where applicable)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model Performance

| Model                            | Accuracy |
|----------------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression (10-fold CV) | 0.898    |
| Logistic Poly (10-fold CV)       | 0.899    |
| LDA (Test/Train & LOOCV)         | 0.893    |
| QDA                              | \~0.886  |
| KNN (K=42)                       | 0.841    |

Top performer: Logistic regression with polynomial terms and 10-fold cross-validation, with \~90% accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Findings

-   Playing at home significantly improves chances of winning goal majority.
-   Higher Fenwick Percentage (better quality possession) is a strong positive predictor.
-   More shot attempts (regardless of quality) actually decrease likelihood of winning.
-   Shot quality (not just quantity)—especially rebounds and high-danger chances—strongly influence classification success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Implications

-   Coaches should emphasize high-quality shot creation and possession control, not just total shot volume.
-   The logistic model’s interpretability makes it a useful tool for real-time or season-long strategy planning.
-   Game location and rebound behavior should inform scouting reports and line changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Limitations

-   Results reflect only even-strength play—special teams (power play, penalty kill) are not included.
-   The `xresult` target is based on expected goals, not actual score outcomes.

### Complete Analysis

I authored the following R code to arrive at the insights summarized above.
