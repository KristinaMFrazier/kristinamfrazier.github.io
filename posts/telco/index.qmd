### Introduction

**Course**: ITEC 621 "Predictive Analytics"

For this project, I worked with a fellow classmate to build a classification model to predict customer churn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Business Problem

Customer churn threatens revenue and growth in industries like telecommunications. The goal of this project was to build a predictive model to classify customers as high or low churn risk—allowing Telco to proactively address churn and improve customer retention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Predictors Analyzed

-   **Tenure**: Longer tenure = lower churn
-   **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges = higher churn
-   **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn
-   **Internet Service Type**: Quality and availability impact churn risk

Other significant variables: `SeniorCitizen`, `MultipleLines`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `TotalCharges`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Insights

-   Average customer tenure: **32 months**
-   Churn negatively correlated with **tenure** and **contract length**
-   Customers with long-term contracts are more likely to stay
-   Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Methods & Modeling

Three classification models were developed using a 60/40 train/test split and a threshold of **0.35** (to balance sensitivity and specificity):

1.  **Logistic Regression**
2.  **Linear Discriminant Analysis**
3.  **Random Forest** (bagging approach, `mtry = 8`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model Performance

-   All models achieved \~**77% accuracy**
-   **Higher specificity** than sensitivity due to class imbalance
-   Logistic regression chosen for its **interpretability** and business value

> Recommended strategy: **Lower the threshold** to increase **sensitivity**, even at the cost of more false positives—because missing churners is riskier than flagging false ones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Final Recommendation

Use the **logistic regression model** to guide customer retention efforts. It provides interpretable coefficients for business decisions and aligns best with Telco’s goal of predicting and preventing customer churn.

### Complete Analysis

I authored the following R code to arrive at the insights summarized above.
